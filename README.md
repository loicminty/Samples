# Samples
Generative sequencing patch for hardware

Based around the Elektron Model:Samples, I used Max MSP to communicate MIDI messages directed mainly at pitch, volume and sequencing but also affecting tempo, program changes and CC controls. This essentially renders the Samples sequencing engine as useless but brings out Elektron’s powerful sampling and sound processing programs instead. 

While the melody and rhythmic sequence of each of the 6 voices can be randomly generated, there are still broad parameters such as density and scale which allow for a certain intention and structure to this randomness. Each melody is also based on a variety of scales in which notes can either be played in sequence or randomly through a weighted probability table. 

Flucoma

The flucoma amplitude slicing patch is paired with the sequencing device and can either receive or send synchronization messages. There is always an element of surprise listening through Flucoma’s selection of loops which can sometimes bring about iregular rhythms or textures that overlap well with the drum machine. The samples themselves can then also be sequenced and played in a number of different ways that affect the drum machine engine.
